    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In Chapter six of River Town, the metaphor of &ldquo;storm&rdquo; is incredibly ingenious, much like the line from <em>Border Town</em>: &ldquo;The heavy rain washed everything, yet it washed away nothing.&rdquo; True, storms rinsed both HongKong and Fuling the night of HongKong‚Äôs handover to China. Yet only when people, like Andy in <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, allow the rain to cleanse the blockages and stubbornness deep within their souls, and reach their arms out to the sky, can they attain true liberation.</p>
<p>The book described Chinese students being forced to stay awake until midnight to watch the handover ceremony on TV, since the dormitory gates was locked by staff and nobody was allow to sleep. So, instead, they laughed at Prince Charles and mocked at flag bearers wearing Scottish kilts. It seems like that Chinese people hate it when Westerns make fun of their skin color and accent, yet they enjoy doing it themselves. When the author first stepped foot in Fuling, he experienced kids throwing stuff at him, and people yelling at him, saying &lsquo;Ha-llo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo! Yanggoitsu*!&rsquo; and stuff. As the author commented, &lsquo;China can never be criticized (page 181)&rsquo;, people tend to have double-standards.</p>
<p>Also in the book, the author asked his Chinese student XueSong Wang, who was only 8 yrs old at that time, which countries were the foes of their nation. He noted Britain for &lsquo;stealing&rsquo; HongKong, Japan for the Nanjing Massacre and Portugal for taking Canton (actually its Macau, he got it wrong). But when the author asked about the allies of China, Wang was left speechless. And that&rsquo;s easy to understand, not to mention the &lsquo;fifty five days in Peking&rsquo;, what about Netherlands which took Taiwan? Russia which occupied outer Manchurian? French which held Indochina? Deutschland which captured Shandong? And Soviet Union which attacked Zhenbao Island? Crossed them out from the list, and what true friend do we have? We forget our mistakes and wrongs so easily, but carve others&rsquo; debt into our bones. Again, we were too stubborn to be criticized,  and despite all that, we claim that we have &lsquo;waken up&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Moreover, the common characters in the book exhibit a sense of being &lsquo;warm and vibrant up close, yet numb and cold from a distance.&rsquo; This is evident whether for the porters (Bangbangjun*) or the impoverished families from Jiangdong, both influenced by the flood created by the Three Gorges Project. The fact that the waterline would eventually tower above people‚Äôs height yet they were completely silent about this, carries a strong sense of unreality and absurdity.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>&lsquo;Yanggoitsu&rsquo; means &lsquo;damned foreigners&rsquo; in Chinese.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Bangbangjun&rsquo; refers to the coolies who carries cargo up and down hills by carts.</li>
