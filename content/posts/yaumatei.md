What is HongKong? What is it in its pure form, in a most representative phrase, in just words without bias? No other place dare to utter before YauMaTei makes its point.

I find myself always agitated to be surrounded by old, down-to-earth, and perhaps dusty, dirty alleyways. It's not just about the unique historic scent. Yet, still worth mentioning, the old city wall of Peking and the brick-stone alleys in Shanghai have been mostly arbitrarily wiped out, which makes this block in HongKong appears to be a solitary time-space isolated from the modern world.

When I wandered randomly in YauMaTei, the sole deafening word that echoed in my mind is 'beauty'. Though the aesthetic value may be nebulous to many,  it was very certain in my eyes. Take a step into the grand fruit fair in town, and a sense of vitality surrounds you. Countless fruit stands on both sides forms a double-layered rainbow better than any others. People, sweating, yelling, talking, arguing, walking, picking, doing anything and everything weaves order in disorder, chaotic yet organized. This reminds me of how Peter Hessler perceived and presented Chinese civilian in his book *River Town*. They were in their many, but still living their own. Anchoring oneself in a pool of people is what Chinese people must nurture and get used to as they grow. Man and manpower is the least valuable thing in the country, yet they still managed to live with fortitude and pride.

If we neglect the people, and only amaze the alley views, you would find countless AC outdoor units, topping stories over stories, and wires climbing celling by celling, they are the blossoms and vines of a city. Cars squeezing the streets, and buildings crowding the space, they are the streams and trees of a city. Put together, that's perhaps why we call this city a concrete forest. Yet unlike other cities, YauMaTei is high-rise-free, everything is earthly and down-right worldly.
